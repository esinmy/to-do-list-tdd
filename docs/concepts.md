# Useful Concepts

#### Expected failure
When a test fails in the way that we expected it to.

#### Functional Test
Functional Test == Acceptance Test == End-to-End Test

What I call functional tests, some people prefer to call acceptance tests, or end-to-end tests. The main point is that these kinds of tests look at how the whole application functions, from the outside. Another term is black box test, because the test doesnâ€™t know anything about the internals of the system under test.

#### User Story
A description of how the application will work from the point of view of the user. 
Used to structure a functional test.

#### The unit-test/code cycle
1. Run the unit tests in the terminal.
2. Make a minimal code change in the editor.
3. Repeat!
